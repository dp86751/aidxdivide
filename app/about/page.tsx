      <p style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
        AIxDivide was created to address the growing gap between people who
        benefit from modern technology and those who are left behind due to
        limited access, resources, or education.

        As artificial intelligence becomes more common in schools, workplaces,
        and everyday life, many communities still lack clear, trustworthy
        explanations of how these tools work or how to use them safely and
        effectively.
